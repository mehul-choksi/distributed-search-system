If it was possible, I would give ZERO rating for this fraud app. The subscription is as high as 6200/- Indian Rupee per WEEk!!! W T F.

Don't download this app. It will trick you to subscribe to an expensive subscription which charges you $99 per week. Then, if you cancel, will trick you to watch video reward ads. Just stay away from this app.

You have to add credit card details and start trial (after which there's 70eur per week fee!) to get your horoscope. Please report this app to be removed from Google apps. It is fraud to say it's free when you can do nothing without payment.
