This is the best app I have!! Its so useful for everything, even pictures, special documents, I can forward anything I want by email etc. It evens up all the edges, so it becomes a normal pdf document or jpeg. The best thing is it has it's own library and all files can be renamed, so I can search my...

LOVE this app! I use it all the time for taking pictures of recipes, documents, old pictures, receipts, pages of books. I can rename them to easily find anything I've taken a picture of. I can share them as a pdf or jpg, text them or email them to myself or a friend. Then download them into my compu...

After the piracy warnings to delete the app, CamScanner actually went into an aggressive sale mode, and even my request to delete my account was answered with a suggestion to purchase their cloud services. Tone-deaf support, takes forever to respond, and an unsafe app. Just do a Google search on Cam...

This app has been my "Go to" Scanner app for several years... I still very much like it and wish I could use it for a long time to come.

I'm absolutely impressed with this app. It saved me hours worth of time in scanning and photoshopping. It's cropping and color balancing is nearly flawless. And the best thing- I don't need my PC and scanner, I can just make a decent PDF file with my phone anywhere. Kudos to the developers.

Easy to use and very convenient! I like that I can edit (I really appreciate that I can drag each point to the exact corner of the documents I want to scan instead of just the edges!!) and save the files to my Google Drive so I can then access to my computer easily. :)

Two strikes, you're gone. 1: an over-priced subscription service. I already paid for it, I'm not going to keep paying for it. 2: the iOS version has a trojan delivery system built in.

best app ever !!🥰.. But what i hate the most about this app is that it gives you a 400MB for saving your files in the cloud.. and wow that's really greedy from the app developer... It should at least gives all of the free members a 1GB data for us to save our files... 400MB is really really low !!!...

This used to be a great app. I bought the full version of the app years back, but now they want a ridiculously priced subscription to use what I already paid for. Dropbox and many other services have free scanning built in, so good luck competing with that. Nice bait and switch you guys are running.

Extremely versatile and useful for both business and personal. Rearranged the page no matter what angle you take the photo at in order to show it as though it's flat. I love this app and recommend it to anyone who requires paperwork to be uploaded but doesn't have a scanner on their printer.

Thanks Please add as soon ...

You should at least not put restrictions on the scan quality..... Using this app is a costly affair. Adobe scan doesn't put restrictions on the quality and you can do pretty much everything there , also it doesn't even have a watermark. Adobe Scan is a better alternative.

It works nicely for some period after that it wont open at all. I waited for quite a long time because I had my imp documents in it. But it was all in vain. I have to reinstall the app so that I can recover my documents if they are still there.. But I lost all of them. So be careful.

I have used this app on countless occasions to scan a form and make it into a PDF so I can send to employers, businesses, etc. Very useful. Get it you will not regret it. Especially when applying for a new job. You can scan in your birth certificate and marriage license for insurance etc.

Scam. Paid for the full version ($15) now they are pushing a subscription model and took away everything from the premium users. Nonstop pop-ups in the app unless I 'upgrade'. Google has a free secure scanner. Switch to that!

Even with the paid version of the app it is still trying to upsell me on things. It really ruins the experience by making me do unnecessary clicks to get rid of the ads for more. It used to be much better.

This is the best scanning app in market. Period. The Pro version let you scan with great clarify. If you don't want to pay for the pro version you can use 'Noteblock' app that has similar features but free but file sizes of CamScanner is small and have same kind of clarity as Noteblock.

I bought the pro version years ago. They recently infected their software with malware so you were forced to reinstall. All documents are lost! And now they want you to pay monthly. I request fulfillment of the contract and want the old version back! This is fraud!

In the update i have found that Camscanner has reduced the resolution of the images and forcing the users to use paid services for the same thing which was previously free. I have purchased the license but know you are tricking to make license worthless.

The app used to perform well, with minimal fuss. Now however, the developers are going all-out to leverage the user base to make money by making more and more of the functionality "Premium only". The katest move is to restrict the resolutions possible on the non-premium version. In other words, far ...

This app is fraud. If you cancel the free trial they will bill you anyway. The app merely duplicates functionality already on most phones and adds a bunch of cheap tricks to try to get you into the free trial -- so they can start billing fraudulently. Do not recommend trying.

It's a piece of garbage, if you're using free version of this app. awkward interface, and the quality of scanned documents is not quite good, through it had some useful options, but yet it's not any exception.

I would understand ads, videos etc..but to put a stamp on each document converted to pdf..that's just lame..so if I want to scan an official document, the person or institution who I'm sending it to MUST know it was scanned by cam scanner....uninstalling this asap

Excellent app. We use it extensively in school, both in the office and by teachers. Love the ease of scanning, clarity, filters, sharing, book scanning features. Do wish you would offer the premium/business features completely free to educational institutions.

Excellent and honest application, never had a fraudulant issue yet that i am aware of. I can only hope that the public adverts about CS has been corrected. I am a paying customer since week 1. Hope to continue to be a paying customer and that the reported severe security incidents have been correcte...

Great little app but new versions adding more nag screens and watermark unless you purchase. I have the older one in apk and will install that one without the watermark. I'm using this only for occasional scan a few times a year.

I really liked this app. In any moment I can copy a document and save it in my network folder. I hardly ever use my scanner at home anymore.

Developer has lost all my trust with making paid for premium features now only available by subscription, and recently including Trojan dropper in the software. Also if you "try" the premium trial you will automatically start getting billed after the trial period is over.

This is the best scanner I have ever used on Android. I love the way it realligns, zooms in and enhances the clarity of anything and everything I scan. Simple and hassle free sharing of documents.

UPDATE: CamScanner are actually CanScammer. They changed their business model (may be addition of trojan was their own stunt) to being in this subscription based model by cheating people. They didn't oblige to notify anyone, they just cancelled and took back all premium features for which millions o...

It was great when I first installed it and worked great for a few years, but now they want me to do a yearly subscription, have raised the price and put limitations on an app which I paid for, because I needed the unlimited use

Opportunity to improve? After installation I have seen frequently your message, where I can give only 5 ratings. Think of rating gives you opportunity to improve. You can collect the data of customer's need & you are missing that. It's only your customer's shows you where is customer's dissatisfacti...

I love this program it's the best application however it used to be better I still give it 5 stars there's a lot of things it tries to help with which is not always useful but it's the best PDF creator of its kind I couldn't do my job without it.

I used to love this apps, saved me so much trouble looking for a scanner device (which often) during work. But now, I can't use it anymore. It can't be opened. Try to reinstall but failed, still not working.

Easy to operate and very efficient the price is awful high maybe a one time purchase fee for the app would be suitable. Like say the app Microsoft Office but please don't make it that expensive. Great app!!

Best App to Scan Documents. Auto Focuses the documents. Glitch is that, I don't whether some files are saved & where they are saved. (Those are not available in CamScanner folder also).
