Has evolved into money sucking app - you can only video chat people by paying now. They take a percentage of the receiver's coins and your "chat" friends drain you dry just to see them live. Horrible!

Doesn't work with Android 9 . When calling it just says dialing and dialing. Only gets to ringing on wifi for some reason. Reading the reviews seems to be a problem for lots of people. Don't see a hell of a lot of response from Tango. Been non-functional for a couple weeks already. Doesn't work with...

It no longer works well after a few unnecessary updates unfortunately. It now freezes and lags, furthermore I can't even make regular calls through the app anymore let alone video calls. I'm going to uninstall & check out something called whatsapp.

me and my friend is using this , the main problem is we are buying coins for cash and when sending sooo soooo many coins are missing , we pay for each coin and they receive few .. its better not to buy coins , simply sit and watch others broadcast

It's not a bad experience but my question is that the gaming part when video chatting only works with iphones.

After I send 10 free messages on live broadcast it asks me to send a gift to continue chatting, then after I send gift it still says to send gift even though the streamer receives it. I have to restart my phone on every broadcast I join to be able to continue

they have changed the app so you get ripped off. if you join a broadcaster on their private, and the broadcast ends, even if it's only for a half a second they get to keep your coins and you can't re-watch the broadcast anymore. Why risk giving money for NOTHING!

Most of the broadcasters are cheater. They call for the private show. After receiving your payment, they stop the show. I had lodged so many complaints, but no action had been taken by the organisers. Don't install. If you have lot of money, then proceed.

The notifications and adding to my home screen??? Don't ever add to my home screen. You should allow people to turn notifications on not have them all on and we as a user have to figure out how to turn them off. Too much control.

From one of the best to one of the worst. These new changes only heralds the demise of Tango. Without "nearby friends" Tango is inching inexorably to its demise. I have no need for all these rubbish video clips . And I believe its so for a vast majority.

I had not used this app in 5 years. I returned only to find it's basically a prostitution app. I witnessed a woman speak in clear spanish-- asking for the highest priced gifts(a yacht, pearl,etc) to do private chat with a gentleman. Tango, put a stop to this!. And also way too many ads.
