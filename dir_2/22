I am sorry but the new design/UX sucks. Stop copying tinder, those cards you could slide through the people you crossed made you better than them. Just making the photos slide vertically instead of horizontally is not original at all... I know you now have the map thing but the cards are way smaller...

I recently joined happn again and I was looking forward to a good experience at the app. After using is it for a while now, here is my feedback. The quality of profiles shown to me are not at all up to the 'so called high standards'. People are using quotes & random pictures of celebs in their profi...

Hey Bharat, it is strange that you get male profiles if you did not set that in your preferences. Are you sure you set your crossing preferences to women only? See you soon on happn! Bruno from happn

This is a terrible app. I opened it yesterday and it worked fine. Today, there are no people showing up at all and it said I had hidden profiles of literally dozens of people. I had never even hidden one profile. There were no articles explaining how to fix this other than uninstalling and reinstall...

I use the app here and there and I feel like it's not at it's fullest potential say what you want and the developers can say what they want as well. in the app to know who likes you or not you need to pay RIDICULOUS !!! and to talk to users only when a crunch is made in other apps there's no such th...

Happn team is the worst team ever. They take so long time to reply to the questions. Poor service and the dating app is not so effective. The idea of purchasing the premium membership is highly discouraged. it is because not many people use it. And so you will need to wait until someone cross your p...

Every time i opened the app it had a popup to ask me to pay for premium. It was just annoying. Also doesnt seem to have a strong userbase and takes way too long (20-30s) to load the list of people around me. Ultimately just not in competition with the reliable apps.

The user base is very small compared to other apps, and it ends up being repetitive when it shows you the same 35 people around you (many times not so close) over and over again. Also the information you cna pick up on people is too limited. Still a nice idea, and I've had a few matches and conversa...

Every time I try to use the feature "hide my profile" for a few hours, my profile is hidden and I cannot see anyone anymore for several weeks. I'm very close to deleting the app, since I cannot use the app for weeks. Also, notifications are unpredictable (I chose to receive notifications only for me...

The new layout that copies Tinder is horrible. Gone is the ability to survey who you have crossed paths with recently and select a few YOU might like to talk with next. Now forced to make a decision on the spot about dozens of strangers in order to continue, regardless of your feelings.

Location doesn't seem to update unless I'm on the app at every location, which pretty much makes it Tinder. Gives me places I "may" cross paths with people in that I've not been since having the app. Messaged support and they give you the whole typical approach, have you tried turning it on and off ...

I can't use the Timeline anymore because, as a Premium member, if I start sending Likes then I will no longer be able to tell who I have sent Hellos to. (the app lies by claiming "Secretly Liked" after 24 hours of sending a Hello). Also there is no reason for a Premium member to send Likes, since we...

Yea so the app doesn't work Unless you have it open when your travel. If not, you can go for a trip round europe, open the app and there's nothing.

The app is good, but the premium feature is a scam. Bought a one month premium just to try out, it's £22 instead of £12 if taking a yearly premium, however after a month my premium didn't expire and just renewed itself, billing me another £22 again. Lucky me it's done through Paypal, I'll oppose the...

Happn is the worst app i have ever seen.... No followups, no updates, no paths, even the main downgrade point is about Hello count ... When you install the app and register for first time. It will boost you 3 hellos which means if you crosspath anyone so that you can say hello to only 3 people and l...

In the use of the process has been found to pop up the information to sign up premium, but I ignored. I only used it for one day after installation, and I found it banded my account when I logged in again. This software development just want make money behavior, is really hateful.

This is one of the best dating apps I've seen for a very long time, you get matched with people who you cross paths with so there are very few random matches. There is only one down side to this app and that is that you can't talk to people without upgrading to a premium account but you don't get pr...

Absolutely horrendous. App contact makes it impossible to actually contact them. No email actually ends up going through. I got a one month subscription and a new phone so when I went to install it again the new subscription would not work. Horrible support.

The app is not welcoming to transgender people. It forces us to choose M or F. I add text in my profile explaining that I am trans. Of course, some people do not read this, so I always tell them I am trans via message. Inevitably some of the people then report my profile (because they do not like tr...

Uninstalled because 1) it sucks 2) it periodically kills my Bluetooth connection. That makes zero sense, but if I have the app installed then sure enough my Bluetooth will cut out every 10 min or so and I'll get a notification saying specifically that happn turned it off.

Hey Sean, this bug has been fixed now so you can start using the app again without having your Bluetooth being cut off. See you soon on happn! Bruno from happn

The new update is so desapointing ... to the point that I am thinking of removing this app!!! It is now just another tinder! You have to like or dislike right away!! Also there is no way to refresh the app like before. i only see people from july now and still need to like or dislike!!!! BAD MOVE!!!...
happnSeptember 30, 2019
Hello Stephane, we have conducted studies and it turns out this new interface helps getting more Crushes! However, the refreshing issue is rather strange: I suggest you contact the Customer Service. As far as your Crush disappearing, it is because that user either deleted their account or blocked you. See you soon on happn! Bruno

I used to like this app. Latest version is plainly horrible. It FORCE you to make a choice on a given profile instead of scrolling and making a decission later. Sometimes you get profiles wirh only one photo and you can wait until it is enriched by new user. I stopped using it because of this.

Shoeoff app, shows many things for attracting but when you use it you find only app notification you will find. Beyond that nothing else. It force you to take premium to see who likes you, it wont show people who likes you. And lot of bugs, data management is very poor

Poor design choices. I used this app a year ago and I only had to scroll through a list of people. Now I have to either pass or like every single person to be able to see the next one? I lose more time this way. If it isn't broken, don't fix it.

Yet another way to ruin your self confidence with endless swiping, never finding a match. It's an intriguing concept, though. If you are the kind of person that people can't resist trying to take you home, this is probably going to work for you. So far, this average person is finding nothing but a g...

Terrible. Gets worse with every update. A nice idea that did once differentiate it, it's now become nothing more than an advert-in-an-app, with occasional & very limited options to like profiles. So full of ads though, it's awful to use.

Every update makes the app worst to use with more and more ads, fewer free likes and closer to Tinder. The first interface with 2 rows was much better, really don't like the new visual so I'm uninstalling it What was a really nice app has become a pretty poor Tinder knockoff, it's a shame

Hello S S, we’re sorry to hear that you didn’t like the new interface. This way of browsing is meant to help you shape your destiny and get Crushes!

Hello Ode, There is a paragrap in our FAQ which explains that selecting a profile when playing CrushTime sends a Like to the other user. As regards the notifications, you can turn them off in the settings. Finally, keep in mind that you can cross paths with people without seeing them: they could be around the corner of a building for example! Bruno

What's the use of this app if u can't do anything other than just liking profiles if u don't have a premium plan. I have used ₹149 premium plan for a month & i daily used to send 5 hellos to different profiles. But i got no response in return. & Now my one month plan is over and i can't do anything ...

Very misleading! This dating app looked legitimate but required a membership to do anything, so I bought a whole year. I'm in the middle of NYC and no one uses this app!

Do hello's really work when you don't have premium? I've sent up to 15 hello's the past week and didn't get a single response. Do hello's disappear for the person you sent them to after a while? I used to have more crushes and now I don't have any at all. Five stars if I get a useful reply.

Interesting: It suggested matches with people who walked past my house, then uploaded a random selection of photos which weren't me, from my Facebook account without telling me, hence making me look like a creepy fake account. Thanks a bunch. So when you sign up, check & edit your profile ASAP.

Hello Vicky, the notifications you receive about other users Liking your profile is a daily recap that encompasses all of the Likes you have received in the last 24 hours. So it might be that when you get the notification, you have already interacted with the users that have Liked you. This explains why you don't see any new Likers. Bruno, happn

Interesting idea, but too few users where I live, so it requires some amount of patience. I also worry that people can figure out exactly where I live due to the app showing where you've crossed paths. There should be a way to turn off location matching at certain locations.

If you can't send a message to a user for free, there's generally no point for the app! When you can't easily message, it seems like an intrusion of privacy and that the company is only interested in recording location of people around you (and yours as well).

Happn is probably better in big cities. NO ONE is using it in smaller cities. As soon as I downloaded the app, someone "liked" me. The app wants $25 a month for a membership.

Hello Shridhar, Some Indian users sometimes face issues with their bank when buying subscriptions. Users may be temporarily debited and eventually get a full refund from their bank.

it's not free.... you have to buy a premium pack... otherwise only see pictures of some strangers...you can't contact them by any method... without premium pack.
happnJune 12, 2019
Hello avi soni, even though you have to pay for certain features such as sending Hellos⭐️ or accessing the list of people who’ve Liked you, you can use the app freely. So Like ❤️ the people who catch your eye, and if they do the same with you, you have a Crush and can start messaging each other! Seen you soon on happn! 🤗 The happn team

concept was good but limit of sending hellos without subscriptions is too low and we need to buy subscription to see who like us... that messed the app.. Tinder is better than this app

for every thing you need to pay the money it's not worth wasting your time, why do we download the app to use it for messaging right if you are charging for it then will the purpose of downloading it?
happnMay 15, 2019
Hello Pruthviraj, some features you have to pay for on happn but the basic ones are free (browsing, Likes, messages, etc.). See you soon on happn!

I joined 3 days back. Paid 1 month premium subscription. But now the App is asking more money for saying Hello. There is no video to understand how to use it. USELESS

It's cool in theory but even when I turned off certain notifications I still got them. Also... barely anyone responded. I don't like the lack of gender options either. Back to Bumble for me...

The idea is good but in practice it really isn't. I think it is too restrictive and forces you towards premium too much.

This app only is to like other guys pics, if we want to contact them or them send them msg, we need to go for premium pack. why can't we send msgs without going with any subscription. Customer really don't want this charges.

Just like Tinder. You can match boring, pathologically height obsessed women with no description, to never talk to them in most cases. Excellent if you're superficial enough yourself; otherwise it's a waste of time.

Hello, We are sorry for the inconvenience. Google is currently facing issues with their payment methods. Rest assured, the money is not deducted from your bank account.

Hello, The Play Store does temporary authorizations on your account when using a credit or debit card. If the payment is refused, no money will be deducted from your account.
