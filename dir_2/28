I am a VIP member paying for this service. Recently, after a few updates the app has suddenly become worse. It picks up a lot of background noise which was not the case earlier. I am a very old user of this app and never faced such problem before. I used to record songs earlier in the same place as ...

This app is really fun. It is enjoyable and fun whether to practice and strengthen your voice or just for fun. You may not be able to do songs solo very rare, but its not a bad thing to sing duets with other people around the country or the world. There may be a subscription but its free to sing som...

I hate the fact you have to buy a membership to get access to most if not all of the actual good songs, you HAVE to join someone else's recording. I find that stupid, I remember back when you could get credits and buy songs that way. Why did that ever change? Why does everything nowadays have to be ...

It's a great app and I enjoy singing on it, but someone needs to seriously fix the android problem. I have an android and it messes with volume after I've set it, it will turn it quiter then the volume I set it at. Then if I want to redo a song I have to ask someone with an apple phone to hide the p...

I love the app, but it would be so much better if we were able to save songs as drafts to finish later, and be able to redo a certain part (even after posting too). Shouldn't be hard to do if starmaker can do it. Once you mess up, you can't go back and have to start all over. Editing would be a huge...

so close to 5 stars! need to fix the live voice feedback 80% of the time its just that split millisecond delayed when singing live, makes it nearly useless, have seen android users with this issue since 2017, for how much we pay for this, its ridiculous!!! we don't care so much about voice effects, ...

Pay to play? No thank you! I was suggested this app by a friend. I thought I was going to like it, but it basically forces you to pay to use it if you want to sing solo. And I deleted three recordings before I found the sync up and fixed the voice/music sync problem. There's no tutorial, no warnings...

This app is not suited for android users in most every way. Seems to cater to mostly apple users. I'm not sure why this app is even here in Google play. If you do purchase dont expect much of an experience with the live jam. Unless you like to be consistently kicked out of the app. If that's your th...

1. Can't pick some people, if you pick them the name would be reflected on the top with us but the person isn't available on mic or on screen.

You can only sing by yourself as VIP. Otherwise you are forced to sing a duet, which felt weird - I was with someone, I doubt it was live, she had a great voice and perfect singing. So it's more like, pay in order to sing yourself. Otherwise, don't pay to listen how cool are others, which I am not i...

Incompatible with all non-iphones. I have tried to use this app with five different Android phones and a pixel3. Fails to record through the use of microphone (phone & headsets). I have waited two years (early 2016) for this to be resolved, only to find out that the developer only caters to Apple pr...

I contacted support about my voice being distorted no matter how I recorded. It is low and static-like, almost like Darth-Vader. They haven't fixed it. It makes the entire app useless for me. Some others have this problem as well, but I don't see very many questions on it, so maybe it isn't common.

Why are you guys kept updating unnecessary things such as gifts? Most singers literally have lots of problem with the personal message and the vip subscription.

Highly unimpressive, I heard this used to be good in the past (JOIN VIP!) There's a very limited selection of songs fully open to use (JOIN VIP!) You are forced to join other people, fine if you want that (JOIN VIP!) but it seems foolish to bug new users for money for VIP before they've had a chance...

I've tried two songs already and the synchronization is completely off, making everyone sound bad. Not to mention that this app will pester you to spend money on it after every session.

pros and cons for smule on apple and android Apple Pro:When you mess up on a song the app let's you rewind and go back as far as you want. Con: it cost 10 dollars a week or 20 month for VIP.

Love the app. The only problem is after you've recorded and you've gone onto pick the thumbnail and description, there is no way to go back to the recording. So say if you press next by mistake, you either have to post without listening or start again. Is this an option to look into?

Guys, if you want to be the number 1 singing app you need to solve your problems with servers. I have a 400 mega bits optical fiber connection at home and I can't see a single video without having breaks every 5 seconds. I can't listen a whole song when it's a recorded video. You need to fix this!

Great app but maybe not for some phones. I find constant lag and delay when I use it, both in video and audio-only songs.

Don't waste your time on this app! You have to pay for everything if you want to sing, unless you join someone else. They make the ads look like they're part of the app, so you're always clicking ads. The recording quality is terrible, and the app drains battery. It's soo not worth it!!

OMG! Addicted! I love this app so much, and love the options to sing with the artist or with other users, or by yourself - great song selection too. Only downside is that you really do need to subscribe to get the best options.

It's a wonderful platform to express your Passion. would need to start from the beginning if you happen to make a small error even on the last line of a song. The only uneasy thing I came across. Still would do that as, won't get tired in a repeat mode.

-> Actually speaking this app is so good for recordings but the thing is they have an option called Hot. Whenever a joiner who tries to join a song will see that option n will choose songs from that only. But that hot option works very poor... randomly the worst invites will be shown on that option....

Having to pay to sing ANY song solo is such bullcrap. The only time you can sing in this app is when you're singing along with a VIP recording. having to depend on people who do pay, VIPs, to sing the song you want, is so annoying as well. I hope this changes soon, or i will permanently uninstall it

Its a app built for people to upload their personal versions of songs. Which people pay 9.99/weekly to record they're singing of these random song dupes. You can follow/meet people.

VIP is not fit for all. So it should be avoided. We're not able to pay it. Few months ago it was best and made many singers. But now it is not possible for poor one's. We can join only. But we cannot sing solo. I loved this app few months ago. But now I hate this.😞😞😞😞😞😢😢😢😢😢😭😭😭😭😭

Very disappointing that you need to be a VIP PAYER to actually use 98% of this app including recording 99% of songs. Super lame. And definitely NOT worth almost $40 a year... *thumbs WAY down* uninstall.

You have to pay to see your full archive or to sing anything on your own. They got rid of the "watch ads to get tokens for buying songs" thing so free users are effectively screwed.

Its a really good app but I wish you didn't have to be VIP to sing by yourself.

I do not want to pay before trying at least one solo song. According to me, you should allow first one or two solo songs for free. If person loves the experience, he may go for subscription. For example, as of now I do not know how it is better than a karaoke of song available on youtube for free.

This app is fun. But if you want to have the actual fun you are REQUIRED TO PAY! It's a complete RIP OFF! To be VIP which is pretty much required to enjoy this app you will be charged 9.99 / WEEK. Yeah that's not a typo. So a total around $45 / MONTH. What a scam. Dont give them your money.

This app is lots of fun, and even allows you to add your own songs if you want! My only problem is that you have to pay to record solos, or to request a duet. If you're using it for free then you have to hope that someone's already started a recording off the song you want to do.

Okay, where do I start? ...It's good. But VIP sucks, and although it's meant for mobile, I run it on BlueStacks, a mobile emulator for PC. I tried using my Blue Yeti to sing, and, well... It's faster than the song. But oh well.

Good app , but the cost is too high for vip, and a non vip singer have no such good options, he just can join others, join who just pay. singing is art and should be free, but you can only join others in free. That's I don't like. Should give more facilities to non vip singers

Can't sign up for VIP I was direct to the site where you pay, but it will process it due to invalid zip code. I live in Canada and the screen had a Canadian flag. I don't know what to do at this point. Great app, but page for VIP payment is becoming aggravating.

"Free app" ya you have to buy things. FOR EXAMPLE VIP, I can't sing songs if anyone else hasn't sang it if you don't have vip 😤 But it is the best singing app I have had and it isn't just singing. It's actually really fun.

After every updates hidden charges are coming out now every song you sing and record is chargeable. The app owner inspite of enjoying the bites from the network service providers is now started to charge the subscribers. Singing on smule is no more free.

The sound quality is horrible and makes even someone like Whitney Houston sound bad. And such a money grabber. In order to just have fun and sing on your own you need to barrel out money. Not worth it.

I have always loved this app but after switching from ios to android i'm left a bit unsatisfied. you can't scroll through the sound waves like on ios so if you mess up you've to redo the entire song. just confused why androids version is behind despite it being the more generous of the two app store...

Smule com should appreciate the users who have uploaded the music to the songbook that Smule users use the most. But this is not to say thank you for uploading rather uploader have to pay monthly vip for upload the music. Lot of hardships to upload the music to songbook and smule just make a profit

i just dun understand why would you need to be a vip just to sing solo.. u guys need to fix this. its just horrible.. think of the people that dosent have extra money just to pay for it and in the end having terrible quality so be thoughtful..

Very good app. Lyrics if possible be bilingual because pronunciation of hindi in English sometimes becomes confusing.

I have renewed my subscription of Rs. 55 this morning. It is still asking me to pay again everytime I tried to record a song. My question is, how many times do I have to pay Rs. 55 in a month. Please respond.
