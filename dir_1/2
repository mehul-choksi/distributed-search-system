Tike Tok is a great way to express yourself and share your feelings, not only can you choose from an erange of songs, you can also put on cool filters. If I was you I would download tik Tok now, if you don't, you are really missing out on an awesome app. 5/5 stars for me, for sure. Download it now. ...

It's fun but..you have to link phone numbers to exchange messages. Super creepy and not safe for anyon. Can't just upload a few photos with music. You have to choose from their photo templates and they're very minimal choices. You can't search filters that you want to pick which effect you are looki...

I love, love, love the app. However constant failure to even have videos seen discourages even us die hard users. You get about 1% views vs followers ratio. Which a 1% return is an insult. Where you will enjoy using the app. They will only show your videos to a handful of people. For a few minutes. ...

It is a good app. But there are a lot of difficulties. If you make videos properly and good ones, they don't get viral ever. Why is it so?

I like it. I have fun with it. But I have one suggestion I am not if ts been thrown at you guys yet. Cen we have the icons like at the bottom or top of the videos or something. When watching duets the little icons on the right covers the majority of the videos and you can't see what's going on.

It's really good app to fun videos or any video you like to make .and I love it.but one thing bothers me is I can't upload music from my device like before...where is the local library?....I want it.. Because tik tok often don't have musics that I want.

I do think this app is not ok. There is two flaws on this app. 1: The creators of a video should be able to edit the captions on the videos they've posted. 2: You always shadowbanned everyone's, including me and other innocent TikTokers, videos for no apparent reason.

drafts. when you make a video you have the option of drafts. You have it there as drafts. Then you want to make another video and post it. You can't because you have a video in drafts😫. I do not want you to put videos in drafts.

Whenever I try to make a account it always says "sorry, looks like your not eligible for ticktock. But thanks for checking us out!" I'm old enough for a account and it always says that now. I give this two stars because it's a nice app but I can not sign into it. Thank you for reading.

It's alright but it needs to make it easier to find sounds and have more options than just singing. Or allow the user to upload their own sound bytes. As searching for other users should have an age filter so you can find people your age group. Other than that it a pretty neat app.

Tik Tok is amazing... although I do have one problem. I'm on LG, and when I try to do text on my Tik Toks it does not show. I tried to write 'kiwi' once but it did not show up.. please create a new update on the texts. Apple devices can do texts... but LGs cannot! I think that is not fair.
