Tike Tok is a great way to express yourself and share your feelings, not only can you choose from an erange of songs, you can also put on cool filters. If I was you I would download tik Tok now, if you don't, you are really missing out on an awesome app. 5/5 stars for me, for sure. Download it now. ...

It's fun but..you have to link phone numbers to exchange messages. Super creepy and not safe for anyon. Can't just upload a few photos with music.

I love, love, love the app. However constant failure to even have videos seen discourages even us die hard users. You get about 1% views vs followers ratio. Which a 1% return is an insult. Where you will enjoy using the app. They will only show your videos to a handful of people. For a few minutes. ...

It is a good app. But there are a lot of difficulties. If you make videos properly and good ones, they don't get viral ever. Why is it so?

I like it. I have fun with it. But I have one suggestion I am not if ts been thrown at you guys yet. Cen we have the icons like at the bottom or top of the videos or something. When watching duets the little icons on the right covers the majority of the videos and you can't see what's going on.

It's really good app to fun videos or any video you like to make .and I love it.but one thing bothers me is I can't upload music from my device like before...where is the local library?....I want it.. Because tik tok often don't have musics that I want.

I do think this app is not ok. There is two flaws on this app. 1: The creators of a video should be able to edit the captions on the videos they've posted. 2: You always shadowbanned everyone's, including me and other innocent TikTokers, videos for no apparent reason.

I like the app but I hate how it does let you like posts after a bit. People worked hard on the videos so I want to like them but tik tok won't let me. Please fix that.

It's really a good app i liked it very much we can make videos in our style and we can become as stars but commenting videos is very bad i didn't liked it and bad comments for videos and the tiktolkers and another thing we did not get our usual songs. So i will give 4stars. Thank you.

It's alright but it needs to make it easier to find sounds and have more options than just singing. Or allow the user to upload their own sound bytes. As searching for other users should have an age filter so you can find people your age group. Other than that it a pretty neat app.

Tik Tok is amazing... although I do have one problem. I'm on LG, and when I try to do text on my Tik Toks it does not show. I tried to write 'kiwi' once but it did not show up.. please create a new update on the texts. Apple devices can do texts... but LGs cannot! I think that is not fair.

Good app except the app doesn't allow me to access the app around 8pm as everytime I want to go on it says refresh and no connection, so when I look to see if I'm connected it says the wifi provider that I'm with and then when I go on other apps they work normally. So it must be the app it's self.

There is a little thing in place that punishes users for "liking too fast". Mind you the videos are all 60s or less. I've gotten three "like bans" (24hours each) Mind you I watch each video BEFORE liking. Yet I am still being punished. I have contacted support twice now. I didn't get a reply the fir...
