I have a paid account and recently upgraded to 2TB and I still cannot control or see what I can or cannot backup, even when selecting 'see details.' The 'details' are basically turning on or off 3 things: data, multimedia messages or photos/videos. So, if you want to see if a certain folder is being...

Every month I have been paying regularly for my extra cloud space. In Sept 2019, by mistake I did not keep funds in the Debit card account on 28th Sept. Was warned about this and Google said they would take money on 5th Oct. Funds are available from 1st Oct. But, Google has cancelled my cloud accoun...

This app has simply made a happy Google customer.

This app tries to do things unrelated to its purpose. I bought extra storage on my Google account and was asked to download this app to track said storage.

Back-up. Why is there NO back-up option? The app tells me a back-up was done back in Dec 2018. I also wanted to add more storage-cannot do that either. Who programmed this???? So, what can I expect will happen in the future?

The app itself is fine, but it really doesn't serve any purpose that a mobile-friendly website couldn't also do, while not taking up space on my phone. Hotel deals are not deals at all, though. Yikes, why bother if there is no real benefit?

Totally useless app. The only useful feature, that is the device backup, is not working at all, advising me to try again later. So what is the purpose of this app anyway? Does anyone at Google know? L.E.: So, basically Google admits it is an useless app. Chapeau!...

Funny thing is this: Literally nobody at Google can tell me what Google One is! 19.09.30 So if it is a plan for expanded storage why must I purchase additional storage on top of Google One? I think there is a lot of confusion surrounding this feature (?).
Google LLCOctober 8, 2019
Hello, Ernest! Every Google Account starts with 15 GB free storage. When you upgrade to Google One, your total storage increases to 100 GB or more depending on what plan you choose.

Very good app for extended storage. Although, the pricing has no in-between. You either have very low storage, going from a 200gb plan to a 2tb. It's a bit ridiculous as i have only needs for 500gb or one tb would be sufficient. I'm currently paying for a 2tb plan when I would need only 1/3 of it.

Completely uninterested. I keep being harrassed by the Metro service reps when I call ABOUT A TOTALLY UNRELATED PROBLEM. They see I haven't activated the "free 100GB" and go through the whole sales pitch in spite of my needing the other isuse fixed. Twice now they've spammed me with links to set up ...

Useless app and technical support. The tech didn't know what Lenovo was, I had to email him a pic of the box. Then he said another technical support person wouldn't be able to help me. I cancelled my subscription immediately afterwards, I suggest you do the same.

I was previously satisfied with the app, but the new statement that "automatic phone backup is only available through the Google One app" is false and misleading. My Android phone is already fully backed up through existing Google services. I uninstalled.

Hi, Jeff. We appreciate your feedback! Google One's backup features augment the Android device backup by backing up photos and videos in Original quality and your Android Messages. Learn more here: https://bit.ly/2m0oEp6. Hope that helps!

This has to be the one of the most useless apps I've ever seen. This app 1) shows your Google storage space and 2) let's you buy more of it. Both of which you can do from Drive and/or web. It also ... has a list of hotels. What? What's the use case? Why does this app exist?

Useless. What was the point of removing the storage upgrades from Drive and moving it to here? All you had to do was add storage sharing to drive and you would have the same exact thing. Google One just makes it inconvenient to micromanage because you have to keep switching between the two apps.

Hi Andrew. We're aware of an issue with activation over Wi-Fi. Have you tried disconnecting from Wi-Fi and using data only to activate your subscription?

Google One storage options are quite awesome and the support for the app is very good as well, but what is surprising that I've seen it offer me promos on Google Services, such as 3 months of Youtube Red, when I've been a subscriber since the service originally launched. To the point that I was an o...

I've been given this Google One service last year in 2018 for FREE, and I'm grateful for it as always. But particularly speaking of this app, it's just a basic app to manage your Google One subscription and also has options to contact Google via chat, phone and email. I've tried all the three servic...

I uninstalled this app because the free option was not an option. I am a senior. If I pay $2 a month I can't afford an apple or a few bananas. Seriously?! Guess I can't scan Q codes since it said I have to have that app!

Hi Pat. We understand your concern. Google One is a plan for expanded storage that includes extra benefits to help you get more out of Google. Because of that, it does require a paid storage subscription. You can learn more about the benefits of Google One at http://one.google.com. Hope this info helps.

I ordered Google One over a year ago and love having the extra storage for my photos and files, etc. I didnt realize there was an app to monitor it all. Very handy! I also didnt realize Google had support options for Google One users! This is super great! I actually used it and it was fabulous Custo...

So Google support is telling me since I'm not a Metro PCS customer the backups in my storage plan can not be restored. So im paying Google to be my irreplaceable files and storage recycle bin?? Don't allow me to use your backup features of i cannot recover. Craziness!!

Hi Matt. Backup and Restore through the Google One app is only available to Metro by T-Mobile members currently. Some Google apps (such as Drive and Photos) may backup and restore data separately. However, reach out to a Google expert in your app to learn more.

Waited 2 days never heard back. Contacted Google again, explained situation again. They finally get back an...

Hi Jessica, that's not the experience we'd like you to have. However, for your privacy, we can't troubleshoot or investigate account specific issues as a result of Play Store Reviews. We'd recommend giving a Google expert another try by following up on your existing case or creating a new support request. Hope this gets resolved soon.
