Works very well, save for a small problem. Somebody had gotten ahold of my Facebook password (not the account, thankfully,) so I changed my password and told FB to log me off every other app and device I might have been logged into at the time. When I went to log back into messenger, I couldn't see ...

Awesome. When I lost my phone, I used Messenger to text and call. You gotta keep this up for free because you can get all sorts of records and information. It might be invasion of privacy, but if you make it clear to people that these messages are permanent, cover your asses. Make it clear to all of...

Damaged my phone's contacts database after login after reinstalling it from Playstore. Definitely bad that I have to factory reset again my phone the second time this month, but at least now I know who's the culprit behind my phone's contacts database damage. I won't allow it anymore to access my ph...

Messaging is pretty good and smooth. Setup the style you want for the chatroom for you and one person, or many people. The only downside complaint I have is that once a friend goes afk. I am unable to message them or the message won't go through in a period of time. It'll say "sent" but it actually ...

When I send messages to people who aren't on my friends list they almost never get delivered. When I send the messages it says that the people are on messenger and will instantly see my message. They never get the messages. This isn't right. Especially for people who don't know that the messages are...

I really enjoy this app. If you are connected to wifi, messaging people is just as easy and quick as normal texting Also, if you want to shoot someone a random message without actually giving them your phone number this really comes in handy The view in the app is nice and easy to use

great app Edit: Now after the latest update my Talk Back is unable to read anything at all in this app. This is problematic for users who have visual impairments.

One problem I have is that when I've been offline for a while then I connect to the Internet, I still get notifications for EVERY message that I've received even if I've read them on another device already. Is this a problem with the app or my device? My phone doesn't lag because of the notification...

I like how they force updates on us. Basically the app won't load or work properly until you upgrade it. Yes, get updates every week and what is changed? Absolutely nothing except taking too much space. Connection is bullc...ap as usual. Better get the lite version.

It doesn't make sense that I can send a forty six second video but not a twelve second one because it's "too long". And then when I try to trim it, this twelve second video "must be longer than 1 second to trim". Ridiculous.

It should be easier to delete your old friends that you don't hang out or talk to me no more you should have an option where the people you hang out or call every other day should be your little first rule of five of friends where you can make a little bit better and it is awesome awesome

This app used to be legit. You removed the log out function. Now if I need to log out to restart the app, I'm forced to uninstall it. Isn't that funny? Because if you guys give customers a reason, they will end up uninstalling messenger. Facebook will be there, but it won't be the same.

It works well for me mostly, but what I find very frustrating is that it's so easy to inadvertently send emojis when you try to copy or forward a message. Then you can't delete the emoji. I very often send the thumbs down emoji then have to apologize and explain myself! I hate that!

Post-Android 10 update, the app does not natively allow uploading/sending of saved images/screenshots, only showing what is in the camera roll. Screenshots can be shared TO messenger via Google photos, but the app was more convenient on the previous Android version.

Messenger used to be the best voice calling app. It has become unbearable, recently. Connection issues often. The constant updating updates are ruining it. Please, don't cause it to lag behind other calling apps.

What is wrong with you app? Whenever I switch back to my account from another account it won't log me back in. It says session expired and it keeps telling me the same when I enter my email and password that I'm always forced to re-install it again.

I cannot delete a second messenger account from the 'switch account' section anymore! The bin icon appears but when I touch it, it just goes back and no option to delete the account. I have uninstalled he messenger and installed it again MANY times but it is still the same.

Opt out of all facebook devices does not stop messenger, it shows a message that session expired but if you open it again it will log you in without asking for password.

I would like to provide a suggestion... I think it would be really helpful to have a feature where the user can pin a message. The purpose of this is to save the message/s sent so that if they want to go back to it they don't have to scroll so much back to check it out. It would be really helpful. D...

NOT secure. people from off messenger can pretend they are your friends then solicit you for money or send you hacker video links using messenger pretending to be your friend. They can really mess up your facebook account and friends.Too easily hacked and that ruins your day when it happens to you ....

Pls fix that part where the notifications for messages still pops out even if the messages are already read and seen. It should not make popup notifications for the messages you've already read, it should be only for the ones left unread. Your making more updates but it still sucks. The older versio...

I'd give 5 stars if there wasn't a major glitch or whatever it may be. The whole point of messenger is to receive messages from people. Now if you aren't friends with or in a group with someone and they message you, I literally cannot find the messages. I've googled how to find them and end result i...

I don't know what's going on lately, but yesterday, someone's profile picture just disappeared. I've reset, updated, and restarted my phone, thinking that was the issue. But that's not the case. It's just an annoying grey or white freaking bubble. and only for one person? Not to mention the occasion...

It's an ok app... If you don't mind missing messages from your friends. Many times now, a friend would send a message, but is there a notification of any sort? Nope. I have all the notification options on, have the volume turned up on my phone, but I still miss messages due to this app. Some of them...
