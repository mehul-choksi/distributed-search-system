After the last download the pop up don't work. You can only see your messages if you open the app. It doesn't come up like before when you're on your phone. Previously there was a pop up on the top. Even if the screen is off it doesn't beep or vibrate if there are any new messages. If you don't open...

Very important suggestion: Whenever someone adds you in a group, there should be an option for you to review the invite. This is very critical to maintain privacy and at least give you chance to know and understand which group are you being added to. Please consider this in your next update. Just a ...

I had to uninstall Whatsapp some days earlier. And recently, I have reinstalled it. When I have backed up my chats, I am finding the messages not arranged sequentially as they were sent. This problem is prominent for the messages sent at the same time. This seems to be a big problem. I am hoping you...

Since the last update in Sept. I get no notifications when a call is coming in... it is minimized and I have to toggle to that screen then press ans. Wasting precious time.

Writing and sharing photos/videos is fine. Voice calls is okay. But my video calls have no audio! Everytime I download the app it works for a few days and than it stops again.

If I wasnt required to have this for work I would NEVER use it. It's a waste of data and downloads pictures to your phone whenever someone sends a picture. And even if you turn the 'save images to gallery' off it resets when it updates. I lost ALL of my data in under a week due to this. There is als...

Its a really good app & very useful. I am lucky to have many friends & family members in different Countries, on different continents & with this app's video calling, it's like they're just living next door. The extra bonus is being able to have a multiple person group chat. My ONE gripe is that you...

This app is terrific - i can chat with a group, easily add pictures to share, and even call through this app. I really like the feature where you can swipe a comment and add your own beneath it so that your comment doesn't get lost in a sea of comments when you have multiple users or are in multiple...

Gone bad after September 2019 update 1.Now the notification that appears when you get a call no longer appears. All you hear is a ring but don't know where it is.. a local or whatsapp call. 2. Many a times you don't get an incoming call only a text message for a missed call.. That too when you had t...

Your app serves good purpose but it will be more helpful for me if you put an option on my wall that will (enable or disable) viewers to share any of my status.

This app is great. But the "You can only share with up to 5 chats." message should be removed. It still lacks an option to save profile picture. Add that too. The "Last seen" status should also be added. In status, videos should be shared more than 30 seconds. Add dark theme also. Also, make it so t...

I think it is about time WhatsApp has different themes and options for its UI. The green and white is becoming a serious bore. If you can change your chat background at ease, what's stopping you all from enabling this option for 'personalised themes'. What happened to dark mode for WhatsApp?. Its al...

The entire smartphone world should know WhatsApp now, so I'll only comment on 2 issues I've noticed.

It's a decent app. However it's pretty buggy. Despite multiple reinstalls, it often hangs, freezes, doesn't allow sticker pack installs, and sometimes doesn't fetch my notifications. I've checked my battery and app permissions repeatedly to fix these problems but they're still there. I only use it b...

People are using other apps like GB WhatsApp, WhatsApp plus and many more.

This app is amazing no doubt. But because of this it have become easier to cheat on someone.

why does your application limit the number of memberships in a group? for me it's an obstacle to being able to be friends with each other. The second thing is why dont you obtain for us to save any documents attached in external memory as an option in settings.

This is something new i m facing now a days. When i try to trim a status to make it 30 seconds long the app automatically does the adjustment and doesn't really post the exact part of the video that i have trimmed. The starting point is always 1 or 2 seconds ahead of what i trim.

The new update is pure garbage. The app just keeps crashing now every time i try to open a chat so i had to install a previous version, then it auto-updated itself (my fault for that one) and i lost all chats when reinstalling the previous version a second time. (Even the backup)

One of my favorite msg apps...HOWEVER...Make it to where you can change the horrid default green border and chat bubble colors, and ill give the app 5 stars. 😍 This is a long overdue and much needed update. My artist heart has been dying to have this changed.

Updates are excellent. I hope you could enable feature left slide to delete message (currently right slide for replying the message) for a mobile app. Also, to use existing delete button to bold/unbold the text (instead of delete the message). Thank you.

Whatsapp has proven really useful to me in my 2 year use and is probably the best application of communication. The reason for abscence of 5 stars is about how easy it is to spread fake news on this application.

Arrange block options in status itself ...too many time we don't want to see some stupid status from stupid people but need to keep their number in phone list.. Instead of going to individuals and blocking provide option in status itself ALONG with mute/unmute option

Y can't messages have timestamp inscribed on them by default.It will be easy for ppl to recognise old n new msgs n it will avoid confusion over old videos that circulates and this will definitely stop circulation of fake news and message...

I Have one suggestion, that in group chat when we click on msg info, there are two categories i.e Delivered Participants & Seen Participants. there should be 3rd category which shows Pending Participants, so we quickly come to know that who not receive my msg.

I think you should add an approval review when people add you as a participant in a group. Some of us get added to groups without our permission, which result in a whole lot of clutter of media on one's phone.

The easiest way to send a message. But the problem is you must download to open a photo or video. I wish that they can fix that, it's annoying.

All good, but I cant find the setting for "fingerprint reader", where is it in the security or privacy part of the settings? Dont state things are available in the app if they are not.

I think the WhatsApp app is not secure because the receiver can save any messages , photos and videos ...etc by Watusi app , which can save any thing after deletion.

Would be good to learn thing or two from Telegram how not to loose history ever without bothering users with backups. And how not to loose photos and files and recommend to ask to send them again...

Developers should add some features like on IOS (swipe left of texts to see read and unread. Broadcast Messages if it is possible you should change android WhatsApp theme to IOS Whatsapp theme. Anyways Whatsapp is Whatsapp I love it.

The app has been great overall, but it'd really be nice if you introduced a Dark Mode option. I'd be sure to drop a 5 star rating then.

Gesture controls needed. With android phone screens getting really bigger for an average hand. Can we please get gesture controls similar to iOS. Clearing chat, Deleting, Archiving, Moving Back etc. It is a pain using whatsapp menu that r on the top of the screen.

Forces you to share all your contacts with Facebook servers. No way to just add a single number to talk to a single person. Such privacy invasions should be investigated.
