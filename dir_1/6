Its a great app but it doesnt work a lot of the time. Like a month ago when it updated i could not look at peoples messages or posts. It would be all white. It uodated again and started working. It is now doing the same thing. I can not just restart my phone cause it does not work. I have to delete ...

This was a great app. But now my photos and videos are not loading on Instagram. I can't even upload stories because of that. This is getting annoying. PLZ FIX THIS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE! And also, adding to that ,you just removed the Following Tab feature which was so useful to get to know the likes ...

DARK MODE IS FANTASTIC. Thank you. I disagree with people who say it's too dark. Why make the background anything other than pure black? It saves battery on OLED screens (which is most of the market) and looks super slick. Video recording on android needs improvement (double tap to switch from front...

I used this app before and I really enjoyed it. However, I was creating a new account since I got a new phone, and it doesn't work. I tried several of my emails, but none worked. Instead, I was told my email was already in use. From what I saw in other ratings, I'm not the only one experiencing this...

The messaging system is having problems. Once I leave a conversation, I'm stuck on the chat log screen and can't exit it or enter any of the messages. I have to close the app and reopen it. Also, there's no way for me to turn dark mode off and its upsetting. I can't update my Samsung to the required...

I don't understand why most of the time, when I try to upload new post, it won't directly upload and would instead show a loading line which takes forever and what's more frustrating is that most of the time it doesn't get actually posted despite having a strong internet connection. Other times, if ...

The new update has ruined the app completely, it was a great to be able to see the people who you follow and actually have an interest in their lives to see what kind of stuff they enjoy and like , it also helps interact with more people and follow new pages , without it , it just seems more boring ...

Instagram is a great app when I can access it. My account keeps getting disabled (automatically) with no explanation as to how I've violated their terms. There is zero customer service via phone or email. The only way to appeal is through a link on the app that is presented when you attempt to login...

I feel like it's quite annoying, honestly. And by annoying i mean the interface. I hate the layout it feels very "apple-ish" in the worst ways. The things you really want to do is not fluid at all, the settings feel rigid and clunky, and even the help page seems to be littered with bugs that won't l...

I don't agree with removing the following tab. Not everyone is a stalker and the functionality was really great to find accounts with similar interests. Now the social feels void and keeps showing photo and tags I am not interested about in the explore section. Instead of removing the tab it was bet...

One of the most awaited feature, Dark Mode. I appreciate the developers for introducing this feature but the only drawback is .....that's it's wayyy tooo dark . Like literally pitch black. They could have used a bit more lighter theme ,sort of greyish. Also the feature of "follower activity" is remo...

Following activity disappeared. You know, where you see what people like. I deleted the app reloaded it but it didn't improve. It seems that this has only happened to a few accounts. Edit: ok it is gone for good. It was a good social experiment while it lasted. I think that that feature kept people ...

Hi, I hope you read this, I'm so happy with your new update, but why in this update I can't promote an ad story?

It sucks after the latest update. The followimg tab functions like the word-of-mouth way. By removing it, people wouldnt know who or what's out there or popular among your friends to follow. You still can argue when you click the profile you can still see who followed the account. But it is quite te...

It's OK, but for an app that is focused on images it's is infuriating how bad the image posting control is. Why in the flying hell can't I post my portrait image without it being cropped? Why, annoying. It always cuts off important parts of my image. Also why can't I flip animated gifs in stories? I...

The app itself is amazing, there's nothing about it I'd change really. My only problem is that with the new update, it added a dark mode and automatically changed me to that. There is however, no way to turn it off in the app. I've also checked my phones settings, and there's no way there either. In...

The removal of the 'following' activity tab has ruined the Instagram experience for me.

Have you ever heard of the analogy "if it ain't broke, don't fix it"? Well, this applies to Instagram. They've taken what was a user friendly, interactive platform and made it undesirable. The constant algorithm changes, engagement fluctuations, glitches, bugs and prolific advertising has made the a...

Good app. However, the hashtags don't seem to work often. My posts often do not appear when I look up the hashtags, which in a way hinders the purpose of using instagram. Also, stickers sometimes are not available on my one account in the same geography as other. E.g. music sticker is not available ...

This application was working very well, but after the latest update, there were some problems. I can't see other people's feeds even mine. The followers request also cannot be accessed.

I think that removing Following Activity was a wrong move. It really brings down the involvement for the app. It was a fun feature.

Love the app. Not keen on the new update, the black is too harsh. If it's supposed to be a dark mode it's not great. Looks like it's just inverted and high contrast for people with poor eyesight. Would be nice if you could toggle it on/off within the app, or at least tone it down a bit. Please add s...

I find it rather unfortunate that you can't decide if you want to have it on dark or light mode. It's directly built in to whether you have your device set to nightmode or not.

I think its because of the recent update that whenever someone likes my picture i'm taken to the activity tab! If not that I'm redirected to my profile page! It is annoying when I'm looking at someone's profile and I'm taken to some other tab.. bad user experience..I hope you guys will fix this soon...

It's a great app and all,wonderful even because it helps me keep in contact with old friends and see what they're doing in life. Only thing I'd like to see is an enable and disable feature for dark mode Android inside the app. It'd be alot easier to adjust the modes.

Great app, but it becomes unresponsive after a bit sometimes.

On my main account there is no music feature but on my other (new...

It's a very good app to post stories or photos, to talk with your friends, to do live.

I only use this app anymore when a friend tags me in something, or a celebrity posts. However the fact thag we can not switch off dark mode (since its based on system settings) I dont even want to use it for anything anymore. The "dark" mode is just too dark and it look horrendous.

The only reason I have it is that others use it. There's no way to pause videos or skip forward/back, and it's got a few other really annoying things.

Constant crashes and bugs that haven't been fixed in forever.

With the most recent update Instagram got rid of the feed that shows what people you follow like. This helps people find others they may know and taking it out has left me with less to do on the app. I believe this will eventually lead to me not checking Instagram anymore.

Poor. Yet another update that results in the app not starting. Has worked fine for a number of years, but recently released updates have meant no access for the past three weeks. Was hoping that the latest update would fix this problem but no, it still will not start and crashes immediately.

Horrible preset dimensions and messes with my raw edits. I put a picture in a 4:5 adjustment frame so I could show the whole photo.

Generally good but an irritating flaw in the stories feature. When people post stories from a larger phone than mine, the image is clipped on top/bottom. Usually you can't tell but if they've typed text on their photo it is often clipped so I can't read it.

Turning off autoplay videos is now not an option. Frustrating if you are in a quiet place and video sound comes blaring out with no warning.
