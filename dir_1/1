It is a good game,yes, i agree.But sometimes it's damn unbelievable. Like Decembe 2018, all the places in the map were unlocked. Now i see that nothing is there except jungle fall and sky summit. Yeah, i know that we have to unlock it all by ourselves only so you get profit and all. But kindly updat...

I like the actual game it's self. It's just, it keeps buffering. I hate when I have to exit out of the game and then go to the thing were it shows all the apps, remove it from that, and go back in and wait for it to load. And when I lean, sometimes, on the water slide, it won't let me get past the r...

Really enjoy the games. However, think it's time for some new running games. New graphics. It gets tiresome playing the same games over and over. Although the graphics change for each game basicly the running patterns are the same. Need more challenges.

It's a nice game. Although global challenge takes long come back after finishing and you can have a way to save ones progress incase they lost their device so that they can recover their coins and diamonds. And have regular and new challenge since others do take long like the global challenge.

Update is very bad and worse. We can't open different maps places before this it is not like this. There is no new thing and same as before. I suggest don't update the app. It is worse.

with new update yet another world is now locked that was open before, I think that 500 diamonds is a bit much especially when it cost $5 for 50 diamonds. Too bad I really like this game but too expensive. In my opinion not fair to the player.

Blazing Sands, Frozen Shadows, and Lost Jungle are our freemium maps that unlock in rotation. They were temporarily unlocked as a holiday gift for players that hadn't purchased them yet.

So many small bad things but the big question is why do global challenges show up a day (or more) after they do on iOS? Seriously, I've already finished the current one that showed up last night on my iPhone and it's still not showing up for my Android phone...

I don't like being forced to watch the commercial videos before I can move on to the next level. I understand if I want to earn a free save (life) I must watch a video. I'm fine with that. But when I finish a level, I'm being forced to watch a video.
