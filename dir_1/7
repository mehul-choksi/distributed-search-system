Subscription can't be terminated. Account got banned because someone got access to my account. So no two people are allowed. I get banned. Can't access help. Can't cancel subscription because where they say you can on Google Play. You actually can't unless you delete your account which you can't bec...

Doesn't want you to match with anyone. It says I have 5 matches, but I swipe right on literally everyone and I still never match. Even when I pay for Tinder Gold, I still get ads but at least I find my matches. You have to PAY MONEY to find love. That's ridiculous. If I have 12+ matches waiting to b...

I'm not sure why a few things are happening. I was logged into my app, had several matches and two conversations going. Logged into my account on my computer, it then signed me out of the app. So I then sign into the app, all matches and convos are gone. What gives? Now, that I'm a paying member, it...

This app is simple and useful, but there's a glitch where messages/conversations don't show up in your feed, even though they should be there. I looked into this, and apparently people have been having problems with this since 2015. Being essentially locked out of a match by an app that's supposed t...

Tinder is now something akin to a scam, charging as much as they think they can get away with (I have realised I was getting charged 300% more for the same features as other users I know) and putting as many paid obstacles as possible between potential matches. On top of that, it constantly regurgit...

Everything's program by some algorithms. You can have 50 match waiting for you but it will not let you find them so quickly. It Want you to pay to see who matched is the point of there set up. That's there trick is to get you hooked so you can pay for better luck. My experience with tinder seems to ...

It's okay but GPS doesn't work, matches me with people "4 miles away" but are actually London and I live in the country....also can't do lots of stuff without paying.

Pay to play. It's designed to keep you swiping. Profiles are like ships in the night as they never match even if the app is designed to put the profiles which have swiped right on you already. It shows blurred images of people who have already swiped you and once you think you've found them, you don...

Nothing short of a cash grab. Far too many features that were in earlier versions and new useless that exist so people pay money. Hides your matches behind a pay wall. I used boost twice as part of plus and after 5 matches they say nobody is around, only for there to be unlimited people 30 minutes l...

It works. I prefer OKC for the extensive bio. I like reading a short novel about people. It feels like a more informed decision. Tinder limits you to 500 characters and some pictures.

This app is absolutely useless. Can't talk unless you match? Who's brilliant idea was that? Very few search filters. I can only swipe on about 4-5 profiles before it says it can no longer find people in my area. 90% of profiles are either no longer in use or fake and trying to get you to join porn/c...

Unimpressed. The idea is simple, but badly implemented. I think that Tinder is surviving off being popular and nothing else. There's no way to "pass" or "pend" someone presented (e.g. because they're obviously in the middle of creating an account and you want to wait until they're done; or you want ...

This app has so much potential, but falls flat in a few areas. Location/distance should be more specific, as in 30 miles from where you are now, or from where you live.

The app was fine, it doesn't offer much more than other dating apps at this point. The only thing it has going for it is that it's used by a lot more people. I was banned without warning after not using my account for months. And I certainly didn't violate any TOS. I reached out to "support" and was...

Wants to charges an exuberant amount of money to do anything other than swipe. Freezes when I try to change the settings (distance, age). Constantly say"no one new" although I've not been on in a while and changed location. It just doesn't work. I've deleted and reinstalled, same issue. I've tried l...

The new algorithm and shadow banning has destroyed this app. I also know a lot of decent people who have been banned for no reason. I used to get 2000 matches a month in London when it first came out. Now I will be lucky to get 100 and most of those are either bots or people thousands of miles away....

Very bad app on play store for those who are finding love on a dating app. If someone likes you, you can't see their profile and can't even chat with them until you take subscription of tinder gold. This is totally unfair for the people those who cannot take subscription but are here to find their t...

This "pay to see who likes you" approach has killed it. You can swipe right as much as you want, but very, very few people want to pay just to see who liked them in case it's a windup, or it's somebody looking for something you've stated you don't want. You can only start to talk to someone if they ...

Was good for a while, but now they hide almost everyone who swipes right on you. My profile says I have 30+ likes waiting but tells me I've swiped on everybody in a 50 mile radius. The price of gold goes up every month you pay for it, so it's not as cheap as they might make you think. All in all it ...

You really have to tailor your profile to make the best first impression.

This app feels like it's hiding a lot of stuff behind the scenes. A lot of it just feels like, "hey there aren't *any* new people in your area?

Too many bots and if you swipe too much you'll get shadow banned. After getting no matches for a while, I deleted and started an account on a new email.

Tinder hides your 90% of your matches and uses bots to make you buy Gold membership. No matter how many times you swipe or expand your radar, you will never match with them. And then when you do buy Gold membership, they are 12,000 km away and are bots which get deleted soon after. Waste of money an...

Hi there! Try updating your photos or turn on Smart Photos. Pro tip: the information in your bio is just as strong as a quality profile pic because it helps potential matches know more about you. Stay encouraged, we‚Äôre confident a new match is only a few swipes away!

If you are not interested to invest money into this app don't waste your time just to be a +1 to their base users number. Lot of bots, fakes and lot of people not replying.

There are so many inactive users. I get a match about once a week, while the new app Hinge matches me with someone like 3 times a day. The customer service is also really bad.

This app's biggest issues are that it doesn't actively deal with fake accounts/bots or take long-time inactive accounts out of the immediate swipe rotation. Messaging is also in need of improvement (you can't even copy/paste your text as you're writing, nor delete sent DMs). You're also going to get...

The app is functional but the amount of basic features locked behind monetization feels rather exploitive. You CANT see likes you without paying. You CANT re-view your own likes.

Tinder has undergone a pretty unfortunate turn of events since the invent of micro transactions and flawed algorithm.

Please do read the refund policy and all the fine print in it, which usually many do not care to read, at the time of subscription; otherwise you might experience the rip off later. If you see something like 'cancel at any time' or 'monthly bill', it actually wouldn't be like that.

Tinder has its ups and downs but as long as you are presenting yourself nicely and you aren't being cringey you'll probably get some matches.

Tinder is a joke. Yes, you can meet people without a paid subscription but the algorithm is based on how many likes you get not on ANY compatibility. A few photos and 250 characters.

It's okay. If you work it right you can get matches. I don't think that's the problem. The problem is how this app preys on desperate guys.

The app is made to keep you swiping. It can take weeks before someone who likes you, is shown to you. Which makes it harder to benefit from the app if traveling frequently.

Profiles are repeated many times using up your limited swipes so you'll be inclined to pay for tinder plus.

This app is pointless for men, unless you pay constantly for boosts, remake your profile every 3 days, or look like Brad Pitt.

Let me sum this up for everyone: 1. When you match, your match never replies. 2.

Some pictures are stupid, a picture of the sea or a wa...

Any meaningful filtering option is basically non-existent bfrom this app which others do have. It's just a big pic dump with no control over who sees my profile or my preference. It's all designed in a way to promote buying "power ups" to get features that don't really have any benefits.

I have had this app for 2 weeks, so far what I have learned is you get a subscription for $20 but that only allows you to like as many people as you want. If you want to see who "likes you" you apparently have to spend an additional $30. Clearly I have wasted $20. Seems pretty damn pointless to me

I've been using this since I've moved to a new country to meet people. The location is ALWAYS off. I've had my limit set to 20 miles (which is generous where I am) and it gives me people 80 miles away constantly. Whenever friends share profiles, it literally never opens them. Very frustrating.

Bugs abound. At times suddenly needed to relogin. Couldn't open profiles sent by others. Couldn't report accounts bothering/spamming (said failed to report). Often froze after swiping two (sometimes more) profile cards. Other than that, super abundant flakes; and matches met often behaved bad.

It would be great if they had more search preferences. If I could search by race or select what particular race I'm interested in that would be great. Also, a 'what are you looking for?' filter would be good too. Filter it by people looking for hookups, dating, long term, etc.

You don't get matched with your likes. You can swipe all you want, and you can see how many people swiped right on you. But you will almost never get to swipe right on then, so unless you pay, pretty much nothing will happen. It sucks if you can't afford it.

Reinstalled it so that I could unsubscribe again but it's very difficult and I've spent hours trying to find out how to do that. And I'm pretty good with...

Can Tinder team explain me why I got deleted account like every few days??! üò° Never did something wrong. It just asked me for a verification, I did so and then I found out that my account no longer exists. For so many times! Get if fixed, so it could work for people!!

Been using this app for almost 2 years. Tinder doesn't have a really good matching system or they've done it with the intention so people pay for Tinder+.

Totally honest, if you're attractive and witty it works, if you're not, you're better off looking for other apps or trying to join a club or group or something. Just cause you arent getting swipes doesnt mean you cant find a relationship, the algorithm determines your success.

A long time ago this app was a big deal and broke ground, in late 2019 however, tinder is clunky, prone to crashing, nickel and dimes you and competitors have passed it in many areas that actually matter. Will go the way of MySpace soon at this rate without changes.

You can hardly call it a "dating app" when it's clearly designed for quick hookups. No useful features in profile. And it keep trying to scam you to pay for premium (seriously, how much??üòÇ) with false likes. Pretty much useless without it.

It's a good app but for the purpose you want to use it, you waste money for nothing. You can't see who like you if you don't get tinder plus. You get ads and everything but not get what you wanted to do on the app. It's a complete lose of time.

It used to be fun once. Now it doesn't work unless you pay. Which is fine if it was a dollar or two. But these guys just got too greedy and it's way too expensive. It's cheaper to just go out to a bar and meet someone the old way. And there are also other free and cheaper alternatives.

The app is fun, but it now forces you to verify with a phone number even when you log in via Facebook, which if you are traveling you can't do, and thus can't tinder.

The app is easy enough to use and is the only one that I found which allows you to view and chat with matches for free. However most men I have chatted with are using this this site for hook ups or one night stands or fwb. Not a good place to a LTR.

This app will stop showing for profile to force you to pay for gold then after a few more day it will stop showing it again to try and make you buy more things find a different app if I could leave a negative star I would.

Pretty sure tinder just doesn't deliver your messages after you match someone and message them like twice. Unless literally EVERYONE just stops talking and ghosts you in the middle of an engaging conversation. Probably because they want you to keep using the app.

You need to pay to see your matches. Every other app let's you see your matches but for this you need tinder gold for 30$ a month to see who you've paired up with. Not at all worth your time plus the girls on here are unresponsive and low value. Bumble is better.

It's something fun and easy to pass the time if you buy Tinder Gold, $15 a month does seem pretty worth for everything that comes with it and could possibly lead to meeting the one for you.

You can meet people on here, it does take awhile. Draw backs to many fame or old profiles. Also so features are hidden behind a pay wall.

Hi there! Try updating your photos or turn on Smart Photos. Pro tip: the information in your bio is just as strong as a quality profile pic because it helps potential matches know more about you. Stay encouraged, we‚Äôre confident a new match is only a few swipes away!

It is a huge moneygrab you cant do much on it without paying It is also a very poor monetization choice as it is expensive If it was a few quid a month majority woul buy it and as we know in sales volume beats all Dont waste your time on it as you will be limited to what you can do

We think we know what‚Äôs going on: if only some of your potential matches are far away, they‚Äôre most likely using the Passport feature to swipe in your location. Otherwise, double-check that your search radius is set to your preferred distance in the app‚Äôs settings. This could help bring your potential matches closer!

Still full of bugs. App discriminates against age. Switching from recommended to recently active no longer works. Matches you have declined still show up, tapping them says an error occurred.

This app really fell off, if you dont have the paid version its a very poor experience. I understand they need to make money somehow but this app is straight up greedy. The app ends up witholding matches unless you pay. The free version of this app seems more like a lite or trial version. With the p...

be careful to sign up for the gold account, for it will automatically select for auto renewal. Once this happens I have yet to find a way to get it to stop the subscription, it just keeps taking money out of my account, and it states it does so on the 8th of each month, but in fact it does it whenev...

Tinder uses dishonest marketing practices. When it says you have 25+ matches and then you pay for gold and none of those matches show up, it means they lied to you about something in order to get you to purchase the product.

Fundamentally snapped. The idea is you swipe either way and others do the same. when people show interest your told.

Instructions are fake, telling you to tap buttons that do not exist or how to remove payment methods that are not relevant. 2) You cannot contact Tinder to do it for you either as th...

It can be fun to try but, don't plan on actually meeting anyone from it. Over all the app was a waste of time and becoming a member doesn't really help. Fake profiles, scamers trying to get you to other sites, or trying to get your info. There are other dating sites that you can meet real people on ...

same as other people I have been suddenly blocked and support team refuse to say why even though it's my data they hold. tried using a new number and phone but it obviously stores more info about you as as soon as I signed up I got blocked in seconds with an error code again. I can only assume they ...

This is a good app. However, the banning process is FAR too over the top and is completly ridiculous. I have had the app for just under a day and I have already had my accpunt deleted with no way to get it back. There is also the preposterous notion that this ban lasts for 25 years. Its not worth it...

No rating as this is absolutely ridiculous as it only wants you to subscribe and pay. You carnt swipe left or right. on top picks it doesn't allow you to swip left or right. Then to see who likes you , you have to pay. This is my very first experience of dating apps. I am regretting as no matches al...

Can't believe your algorithm flagged a paid user and stopped from ever getting matches again. I tried resetting my account and everything but its still the same thing. Once I used to get about atleast 10 matches a day at minimum and then one night I decided to spam right cause unlimited likes, why n...

Well where do I begin... I've had really bad luck with this app in the two months I've been using it, some of it isn't exactly the apps fault but there is one major problem that is this apps fault. The Shadowbanning. if you don't swipe in a way that pleases the algorithm you'll basically be screwed ...

Overall it's fine. I have a subscription and I notice that often times when I super like a girl her profile pops up again a few hours later or the next day to be rated again. The other day I saw the same profile 3 times after super liking twice, gave a regular like and I didn't see it anymore. I get...

The app is very buggy across the board and after a day of purchasing a year's worth of the gold membership, when I select a new location I get "There's no one new around you." It doesn't matter if I clear cache, clear data, restart the app, restart my phone, re-sign in, etc... It only randomly start...

What a joke. No user support.

Shows me ads even if I have tinder gold. Keeps showing me the same profiles over and over multiple times a day. Frequently sends me notifications that someone liked me when it's not true (probably to lure me back in the app to swipe more). Full of fake profiles (mostly bots trying to scam people)...

The experience is deliberately slowed down for free users to incentivise the buying of gold membership. If someone swipes right on your profile you will they will be added to your gold counter but their profile will not come up for you until after hours or days of swiping, it will be held back. Your...

Even after paying gold for a month, the in app purchases, which almost seem necessary as nothing happens, are so ridiculously priced. Way to take advantage of your user base. It's not like there are free services out there that do the exact same thing and lets you talk to whoever you want.

Overall it's fine. I like a few of the additions since last time I used this, but I find the user interface is less intuitive now. I mostly don't like how people I've already swiped keep showing up in my feed, especially since the free version has a limited number of swipes per day now

Not happy with Tinder Plus or Tinder Gold at all. Yes, it finally turns into a normal dating app but the super-likes are misleading. It says 5 likes a day, but it doesn't reset on each day. Your remaining stays the same and the reset is 24 hours from the last one used. That's pretty much a scam. It ...

My wife and I got shadow banned without warning or further explanation provided. Can't even register as a couple, can't find swingers at all, but only thing you can get is account terminated for no reason. Plus, reading the reviews here, we are so glad we haven't bought the premium.

I can't begin to express how disappointed I was in this app. Everyone is a bot that only wants to spam you with virus-infested porn sites, and Tinder Gold is a total scam in regards that almost nothing was unlocked.

After a little over half a year using this app. I've gotten like 2 matches. I dont think this is a reflection on the app as much as it is a reflection of the people on it.

Overall good service that streamlines the online matchmaking process.

This makes about a 100 mile difference so it's really annoying. Pl...
