After the update of this app, it has become something horrible and very slow, always complaining of the phones either being too far or too close as the reason for the slowness, please do something about this... Prior to the update, the app was the best and very fast.. Please resolve the issue

This app has lost its value! What exactly is your problem duh!? Too close? It gets slowed down. Too far it gets slowed down! This is so annoying. And it's transferring speed is worth mentioning. Slower than a 2G network.

File sending easy and great. But please I keep getting these "connected file has a higher version" (paraphrase) messages which tend to hinder some transfer processes. Id be glad if you could do something about it

It's always better than shareit because there is no ad , however app not allow to transfer file without the access of location, it doesn't need actually, they want to cheat us, hence I uninstalled, I am using iPhone on ios it's completely safe and app doesn't need any of these informations
Xender File Sharing TeamOctober 9, 2019
Sorry Onattu . Due to Andriod's policy , Xender needs these permissions just like other apps. Xender is google important parnter , you can see the news from below : https://t2m.io/NT6hhaLC so xender is following security policy so I hope you can like Xender

The only app of its kind that works for me (I ve tried at least a dozen). The only problem is the QR scanning does not always work, but I can access through the ftp address so its not a total deal breaker but still wish it can be fixes.

Xender File Sharing TeamSeptember 30, 2019
I'm very sorry for that, due to tech problems, all file-sharing apps are required by Google to use QR code for connecting. If you have trouble scanning or connecting, contact my whatsapp +918588813354, I would be happy to help you out.

It's one of the few good apps of file sharing available. Only issue with this app is that compulsion of keeping location on while using the it. Not every time, but it also takes time to connect to other phones due to frequent updates. Must have app in present time.

No proper option of transferring folders from mobile to laptop. You get only photos visible and that too you have to choose one by one. Folders are also transferred in zip format. In short, very cumbersome. There are no option to sort by date or any. Not so good for mobile to pc or laptop transfer.

Please enable option of passcode or something easy so that mobiles can be connected while travelling too, It is to clarify that scanning is bit too difficult while travelling. We will be very happy if you fix this problem at the earliest.
Xender File Sharing TeamSeptember 30, 2019
Hi Gaurav I'm very sorry for your trouble, due to tech problems all file-sharing apps are required by Google to use QR code for connecting. If you have trouble scanning or connecting, please add my whatsapp +918929254383 and I will help you solve the problem. Thanks üòäüòâüòÄüòô Xender loves you

This app deserves 5 star. I don't like shareit at all. Too many ads in it. Whereas Xender is very simple and plain. That's the thing I like most. Shareit force us to switch on bluetooth, whereas xender tells us to turn off the bluetooth for faster transfer rates.

Hi Mortaza, we're sorry to hear this. Movie center and promote website are hidden at a corner only because Xender does not want to bombard users with pages of advertisements like other sharing apps do. If you only want to share files, your experiences on Xender will not be disrupted or disturbed at all. Thanks for more understanding.

You always have to turn your gps on to proceed with transferring your files. The app will not open if a update is available. Very disappointed. üñïüèª
Xender File Sharing TeamOctober 9, 2019
Sorry Avinash. Due to Andriod's policy , Xender needs these permissions just like other apps. Xender is google important parnter , you can see the news from below : https://t2m.io/NT6hhaLC so xender is following security policy so I hope you can like Xender! if any other problem contact me +918929254383.

This one is my best file sharing app. It just works really fast. And it's UI and content is eye catchy + It's too easy to share your files with this app. And it has a code scanner option to connect device through scanning. Awesome app üòçüòçüòç.

It's OK the upgrades are good and the theme well.... Loved it. I'll rate 5 stars but I think in order for you to push yourselves a 4 would be OK so as not to dampen the spirit as well. Good job everyone keep up the good work

i like the app, but the issue is that, you should improve and upgrade the settings of the app, for instance the performance of the theme is not accepting to launch in the app, so you try and figure and also fix the issue.

Ultra fast when it comes to speed, it takes only few seconds to transfer small size files and few minutes for bigger files. Best part is that it saved my data cost because downloading all apps and movies will be very costly

Better than all other wireless transfer providing apps. The main reason I chose Xender is because of NO ADS. Though Ads generate revenue, but this developer mainly focuses on providing the best user experience. Thanks, Xender Team!

As you said latest version of Xender is easy but ther is a problem . With Xiaomi phones Xender is not fully working. When I click send button it prompts to open QR code. In previous version QR code was not necessarily required. This version is worst. It deserve zero stars

i don't like QR scanning because no transferring files at the distance. you must have to go first to the sender ane make connection than file transfered. so QR scanning is not good for those who are sitting in distance area.
Xender File Sharing TeamJuly 29, 2019
I'm very sorry for that, due to tech problems, all file-sharing apps are required by Google to use QR code for connecting.Hope you understand. Please can you give me 5 stars(‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ)? I will be very happy thank you.

The dark mode is horrible. The dark colours which are used for describing an item matches the dark background. Also, the dark mode of Xender hurts the eyes.

Just one word of advice to the developers - We don't need Video Center or suggestions on the videos. This is a file sharing app, keep it that way. Don't go the way of ShareIt.
Xender File Sharing TeamJuly 24, 2019
Hi Prabhu, we're sorry to hear this. Lots of file sharing apps are displays banners and other ads which are basically their major sources of income, Xender is willing to cut this out in order not to disturb user experiences. If you like to share files via,Xender, its functions will remain the same. Thanks for more understanding.
