You Ban people for 1 Month that's not a good thing. What you think one month people wait for you. No it's not.People will uninstall this and will download another apps. If you want to Ban people than ban them for maximum one day not like one month. Reduce your Ban Time.

If you are a male just looking to chat this app is useless you will never see girls unless you pay for it. even though the ads they have show you being able to chat with girls.

Your payment system is rather a cheating sytem and a fraud because even after choosing female more than half of the person matched are male or bots. If we are paying for something provide it with honesty, don't cheat.

No No No. You dont understand, I hate YOUR ads. The cringey, idiotic ads I see from you guys on Snapchat. Stick to the ones where people just smile and theres music playing in the background. None of this stupid bull**** that is trying to be funny but it is really just SO F***ING ANNOYING
