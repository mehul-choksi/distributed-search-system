You Ban people for 1 Month that's not a good thing. What you think one month people wait for you. No it's not.People will uninstall this and will download another apps. If you want to Ban people than ban them for maximum one day not like one month. Reduce your Ban Time.

Your payment system is rather a cheating sytem and a fraud because even after choosing female more than half of the person matched are male or bots. If we are paying for something provide it with honesty, don't cheat.

Sorry for the negative experience. You can report users with fake genders by clicking on the shield with the "!" in the middle while you are matched with them.
